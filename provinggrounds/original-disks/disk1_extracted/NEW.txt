The Proving Grounds is no ordinary BBS,far from it.  It is a game: a gamewhere you, the player, can fighthundreds of different monsters, fightother users, gamble, try to rob thebank, and perform many other fantastictasks.  You can travel into the 1000room adventure complete withteleporters, elevators, inns, pubs,talking characters, holy water,magical items, villages, puzzles,riddles, a 200 room maze, andmuch much more.       You will be given ahalf validated character.  You willget 10 calls, 15-20 minutes a call.You will be able to call up to 2times in one day.  But be wise,you only get 10 calls until yourcharacter is deleted from the board.If you send in the validation feebefore the end of your 10 calls youwill be able to keep your character.What follows is a help file then a feefile.   After reading both files youmay log on and your password will beregistered immediately.  Pleasewrite down your user number and youpassword so you won't forget them.  Ifyou do not wish to read either of thesefiles then press the space bar.P.S  Please do not make more than one     character.  It takes time away     from other users and makes it     even more difficult to get on     the system.  If I catch you using     more than one character, all of     your characters will be deleted.
