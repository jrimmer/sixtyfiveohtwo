Owner Help FileIf your system have been already setup for your computer then you don't have to follow any of these intsturctions.  But it would be wise to read it just so you will know what to do if you want to make modifications to the system in the future.    A) How to get the board running....1.  First off get out a text file editor.  Any wordprocessor will do.  You just need a program with witch you can edit and save text files.2.  Boot up your text file editor.3.  Load the file 'MODULES' off of disk 1.  It should look like this:Apple Cat,YBoard Module,NAdventure,YSysop,OPUSClock,YAfter Each despeription there is a variable:  Either a capital 'Y' or a capital 'N'.  If you have that module/option change the variable to a capital 'Y'.  If you don't change it to a capital 'N'.  There is one other variable, the Sysop variable. Change that variable to your alias.4.  Load the 'DATA' file of disk number 1.  It should look like this:00NTHU SEP 12 (Or some other data)0OPUS (Or some other name)500000000 (Or some other large value)0call the parking lot (415) 525-2716 (Or some other message)7Now, this is importatnt, the second and eighth variables must be zeros.  If they arn't change them to zeros.  You should only change these variables to zero if you do not as yet have any users.  The only variables you should ever change after that are the third and last variables.  The third variable should be changed to a capital 'Y' if you are running the system off of a hard drive or to a capital 'N' if you are running it off of regular disk drives.  Here is what all the variables do:The:1'rst variable determines how many call you have gotten that day.2'nd variable is the number of users you have(deleted slots count to).3'rd variable tells the program if you are running the system off a hard drive.4'th variable is the last date somebody logged on.5'th variable tells how many calls the sytem has received.6'th variable is the last caller.7'th variable is the amount of gold in the bank.8'th variable is the total amout of messages posted.9'th variable is the user posted message.10'th variable determined how many calls Half-Validated users get before they are deleted.  You can change this variable to your liking.5.  Load the 'CONFIG' file off of disk 1.  It should look somewhat like this:ARMOR,254,6,1BDATA,254,6,1BOARDS,254,6,1CONFIG RESET1 DRIVER DRIVER DATA CHAIN,254,6,1DATA,254,6,1DEATH,254,6,2LEVELS,254,6,1MODULES,254,6,1MONSTERS,254,6,1QSCAN,254,6,2RANK,254,6,2EMPTY,254,6,1SPELLS,254,6,1START,254,6,1STATS + DOWNS,254,6,2TOP,254,6,2All READ ONLY TEXT FILES,254,6,1VOTING,254,6,1WEAPONS,254,6,1MAIL,254,6,2ADATA,254,6,2EMPTY,254,6,2CHAR,254,6,2DES,254,6,2ITEMS,254,6,2EMPTY,254,6,2SAVE,254,6,2SHD,254,6,2USE,254,6,2MAIN,254,6,2BRD,254,6,2MA,254,6,1CHAT,254,6,1FIGHT,254,6,1OFF,254,6,1GA,254,6,1STORES,254,6,1ASTART,254,6,1ADVENT,254,6,1JOUST,254,6,1This tells the computer where the files with the same names are.  The first variable is the exact name of the file.  the second is the volume number, the third is the slot number, and the fourth is the drive number.   If you want to switch files to a different location(drive, volume, or whatever) you must change the values coresponding to that change in this file.  For example, say you moved the 'ARMOR" file to Volume 10, Slot 6, drive 1.  You would look for the variables for the file 'ARMOR'.  Once you found the 'ARMOR' file in the you would simply change it to 'ARMOR,010,6,1'.  Then you could copy armor onto volume 10 and delete it off of it's original location.  Yo can do this for almost all of the files.  Some files have to be on the same drive/volume as others.  You will see these in the titles.  For EXAMPLE.  The files 'Config, RESET1, DRIVER, DRIVER DATA, and CHAIN' all have to be on the same volume/drive.  So if you move one you have to move the other.  When you first get your system, it will be configured for either 2 drives or 3 drives or for a hard drive so modification of this file probably will not be neccarry for the time being.One more thing, you must have all the READ ONLY TEXT FILES at the same location.  Thse files include:VOTING.TOPADV.SOLVE AD.DESCNTRL.CHARCSTATFACTSFEESHELPHELP.ADVINFOLOANSLOGMENU.MENU.ADVNEWNEWSOFF1PILLAGEThese MUST ALL BE AT THE SAME LOCATION!!!  I.E. SAME VOLUME/DRIVE.P.S  when changing volume numbers the value most be three digits.  So if you want to move a file to volume 1 change the volume value to '001'.The only problems you might have in the beginning are for slot numbers.  If you have a hard drive it will be configured for slot 7.Some files will not be on any of your disks.  This just means the program will create them later.Reserving Space:Reseve:1 sectors per user for the stat file.  I.E. if you have '150' users the stat file will be 150 sectors long.1/10 sectors per user for the 'TOP' file.1/10 sectors per user for the 'DOWNS' File.1/5 Sectors per users for the 'DEATH' file.VERIFY THE CONFIGURATION SETUP.6.  Ok, now that you have set up your system it is almost ready to run.  Boot up dos and load up the file 'START' from disk 1.  Line number 10 is the location at which the file 'DRIVER' is loacted.  Change that, if need be, to the location of the file 'DRIVER' on your system and then save the file on disk 1.6.5  each new user will take up roughly 2 sectors of disk space so figure this out before you add on to many sub-boards.7.  Load up the file 'COMPLETE EDITOR' off of drive 1 and do the same thing you did with line 10 of start.  Save 'COMPLETE EDITOR'.  This file does not need to be on the system while it is running.  It is a sysop's utilities files.  Put this file on another disk and then delete it off of disk 1.   After doing this run 'COMPLETE EDITOR'.   IF you are going to run the board module type 14 from the complete editors menu.  This function will allow yo to set up your sub-boards.  With each sub-board you can set up volume, drive, slot, an maximum messages on that board. If you set your mamximum message to 30 on one board you should leave 120 sectors free for that sub-board.  Everytime you add or get rid of a sub-board the quickscan status for each users will be reset.8.  After setting up your sub-boards you are ready to run the board.  Run the 'START' program and your system should work.9.  If you don't have the adventure copy these files onto another disk, one that isn't on the system, and then delete them from the text file disk:  ADV.SOLVEAD.DESMENU.ADVHELP.ADV10.  If you have your board module up but then decide to take it down delete all files that look like this:B(followed by any number)/(followed by any number)EXAMPLE:  B2/22and all files like this:S(followed by any number)EXAMPLE:  S3also delete the files 'QSCAN, BOARDS, and BDATA'.11.  If you DON'T have a clock you will have to do two things everynight at 12 or at a specific time.    1)  Change the date of the last caller in the 'DATA' file.  This is the forth variable in the 'DATA' file.   The format must be like this:          SAT SEP 12  or SAT SEP  2       The first three letter word being the day, the second three letter word being the month, the number being the day.       Run the reset file at least once a day if you don't have a clock..  If you don't have a clock you can take the reset file off of it's system disk and put it on another non-system disk.  Do not worry about changing the value in the configuration file.  Before runing the 'RESET1' file you must first load the file 'RESET1' and then catalog the volume on which the file 'CONFIG' is loacated.  Then simply type run.  Do this once a day only if you do not have a clock.  If you do have a clock then it will do all of this for you automatically.    P.S.  any trouble with the clock may result from it not being compactable with a thunderclock.  The system is meant to run with a thunderclock.  Also, the maximum amount of users the system can hold is 500.Well, that's about it.  You can figure the rest out by yourself.  If you have any problem check all the variables in the MODULES, CONFIG, AND DATA file for their accuracy.
