       -=> Castle Help File <=-     Your castle protects any gold you might have stored in it's treasury. The treasury is simply a place to put your gold so that you don't have to keep it on your person.  But there is away a user can get the gold in your treasury:  by attacking your castle, getting by your defences, and then beating you in a fair fight(No spells active).  Once they complete all of this, they then get any and all gold you have in your treasury.  Each castlehas 20 rooms, you and your treasury being in the 20'th.  The first 19 you can edit, placing either monsters, traps, or both in each room.  There is a rent fee though, and this fee is proportional to the amount of protection you have.  The more protection, the higher the fee per call.  Every time you call you must paythis fee before you log off or your defences will go "on strike".   Any user will then be able to walk straightto the treasury(He will still have to kill you although).     In each room you can either have one of four set ups:No monster - No SpellLevel X Monster - No spellNo monster - Spell XLevel X monster - Spell XAs you get more powerful, you are able to higher more powerful monsters.  But the more powerful the monster, the moreit costs you.  Choose your defences wisely and be sure to pay each time you call.  Before you pay, make any changeson your castle you want to.  Any time you makes changes, you have to pay the new balance for that call in full, evenif you payed for that call before.  Be sure to set up your defences wisely andstrategically or you will most likely be robbed.  The best way to understand the castle system is to play around with it for a call or two.  I advise you to do that right now.P.S.  you cannot rob any user that ismore than two levels below you.
