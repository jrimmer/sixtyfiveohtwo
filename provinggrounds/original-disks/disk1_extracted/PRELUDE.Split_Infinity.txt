     The Black Adept has returned!  Histroll armies, fierce and savage, are atthis very moment ravaging the land, killing all that stand in their path. Soon they shall reach the lowlands, entering through The Great Elven Forest,and we will not be able to stop them! Unless someone kills the evil one I am afraid all is lost.  The other Adepts are fools!  They feel that they are safe in castles, that they are not partof these petty mortal squabbles.  They will die under the Black Adepts magic! His callousness makes him powerful, he revels in death and destruction.  You must destroy him along with his castle and all who live there!  This evil mustbe eradicated from the face of this planet!  You are the foretold one.  Youmust perform this task.  Good luck Adventurer, we shall pray for your success.
