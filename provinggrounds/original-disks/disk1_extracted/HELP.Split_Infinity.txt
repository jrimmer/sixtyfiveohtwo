             The Adventure             -------------         Description and Help File       -------------------------Split Infinity is not your average on-line adventure game, is goes far beyondthat limited stage.  It is a work of interactive fiction, complete with colorful descriptions and a consistent well developed plot.  If you have not done so, I urge you to read the preludeto the adventure.  It is very short andwill enlighten you on some important facts about the world you are about to enter.  Prepare yourself!  The adventure is very difficult and at times very tedious.  It will talk long hours of concentration and careful reading if you wish to solve the adventure legitimately.  Of course you can get the solutions from friends, butwhere is the fun in that?  I adamantly urge you to try your utmost to solve this adventure on your own.  But, in the event you find yourself irrevocablystuck, do not feel bad if you have to seek help. The adventure is full of clues to the many puzzles you will find.  Read the descriptions carefully!There are key words planted all throughout the text.  Most importantly,pay attention to what ever any character has to say.  You might run across a priest or a farmer or any other number of strange characters on your quest.  Usually they will have something relevant to say.  I will now briefly talk about some important facts.Inn's:  You will find several inn's located throughout the adventure.  You can stayin a inn for up to five hours, each hour taking only about a second in realtime.  For each hour you stay in the inn, ONE MINUTE will be subtracted fromyour playing time.
